Things to be done for this to be useful:

- Implement timer to disable it after X minutes. Currently it remains configurable for the lifetime of the device. (though this CAN be worked around by calling end() from the  main app)
- Some *very basic* input validation at least
- Re-test the ability to write values > 8 bits.. have I lost that ability with the changed uint methods?
- Auto-generate service and descriptor UUIDs. (Not just that of the characteristic.)


Also,

- Test with more than one config item
- Implement a Read-Only characteristic with some sort of unique identifier (based on MAC address or whatnot - something to differentiate multiple similar devices). Maybe use Manufacturer Data for that.
- More generally, implement some Manufacturer Data.
- Apply values right away but don't make them persistent until BLE disconnect? (This would create some safeguard against storing bad values)?
- co-exist with other BLE services. Someone may want to eg. publish battery percentage.


Later,

- Implement other data types eg strings, bool
- Implement input validation and figure out how to respond to invalid input
